## 6-Port Unmanaged vs 8-Port Switch

When choosing between a 6-port unmanaged** and an 8-port switch, consider your device count and expansion plans:

### 🔹 6-Port Unmanaged Switch
- Best for setups with fewer connected devices
- Often chosen for localized installations such as CCTV clusters, small automation cells, or edge deployments  
- More compact and cost-effective

### 🔹 8-Port Unmanaged Switch
- Offers extra ports for future expansion  
- Preferred where additional wired endpoints are planned  
- Slightly larger and potentially higher cost  

If your network requires exactly six devices and you prioritize industrial mounting and fiber support, a 6-port unmanaged switch like the Versitron model is usually a more precise fit.
